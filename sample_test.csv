Why isn't YouTube flooded with videos showing evidence of fraud? It's because there is exceptionally little fraud happening. And the real reason voter ID laws are being passed is to reduce the number of poor and minorities voting.

With great pomp and ceremony, he left his home and went to the temple. He met with the head monk, who agreed to let him study kung fu at the temple. The rich man shaved his head and donned the robes and was led to a room containing a well and a barrel of water. The monk told him to slap the surface of the water with his palm until no water remained in the barrel. The rich man didn't understand, but did as he was told. He slapped the water with his palm and a little water splashed onto the floor. He repeated the slapping for what seemed like hours until no water remained. He found the monk and told him he had finished. The monk instructed him to fill the barrel again and repeat the task. This scene repeated for days. Eventually, the rich son stopped going to the monk and just refilled the barrel without being told. He grew angry. He suspected he was the butt of a cruel joke, and that the monks would never teach him kung fu but he knew that if he returned to his family having only slapped water he would be a laughingstock. Eventually, the seasons changed and the rich son returned home for the holiday feast. His family was so proud of him for studying kung fu, even though he was secretly ashamed that he had not received even one day's instruction. ""What kung fu did you learn? What did they teach you?"" his family asked, eagerly. ""They didn't teach me anything,"" he mumbled. ""Oh, you are so modest, tell us what they taught you!"" they urged. The man grew enraged. ""They didn't teach me anything!"" he shouted, as he slammed his palm on the table, breaking it in half."
